# Fakehttpstatus

## Description

Only for study, not commercial stuff. Fully open source.

A simple tiny solution for collecting and displaying http status.

Based on python, probably will be running on riscv machines. @~@

This is a not-so-good copy of this project: [httpstat](https://github.com/reorx/httpstat)

## Progress

Currently in the very beginning stage... I guess...

---- Apr 15 2025

Codes mostly done rn, probably require some tests.

And now working on building packages for riscv.
